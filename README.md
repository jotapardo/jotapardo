- 👋 Hi, I’m @jotapardo
- 👀 I’m interested in VueJs projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NetCore Api Services
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Vue and Sql Server projects, and all related in stackoverflow. Love that place! Also I published my repository of an application made in Xamarin. I really did not fall in love with so much process that it takes and how complicated things are with the theme of activities and bah! I left it public to whoever wants to collaborate (MUUSIKA). I even forgot the google play developer password. Success with that!
- 📫 How to reach me in @ing.javierpardo@gmail.com
